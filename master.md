THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO
CREATING CHATBOTS

Customers today are not only picky when buying products,
but they are also demanding when it comes to how companies
interact with them.
The new generation of customers, particularly millennials and
Gen-Zers, expect instant results for the information they are
seeking. If the response to a request is not swift, frustration grows,
resulting in businesses losing potential customers, sales, and
brand reputation.
While a Facebook survey shows that over 50 percent of customers
prefer dealing with an organization that has a conversational
interface, a study by Oracle reveals that more than half of online
customers expect businesses to be available 24/7.
Taking into account the results of such surveys, an increasing
number of companies are investing in AI chatbots to mitigate
customer frustrations, enhance user experieces, and improve their
ability to communicate.
INTRODUCTION
CHATBOTS

The increase in adoption by businesses of all sizes is making
chatbots mainstream, rapidly expanding its ecosystem in diverse
domains, including mobile apps, websites, and messaging
applications.
Business Insider estimates that by 2024 the global chatbot market
will be worth $9.4 billion, growing at a compound annual growth
rate (CAGR) of 29.7 percent.
A research report by Oracle, which includes responses from
chief strategy officers, chief marketing officers, and key decision-
makers, states that 80 percent of the respondents expressed
interest in deploying chatbots by 2020.
The figures indicate that chatbots are here to stay, and soon,
AI-powered chatbot solutions will stretch its horizons to
dramatically transform the way organizations communicate with
customers.
In this handy guidebook, we explore chatbots, their applications
in a real-world scenario, and things you should know to build a
career in the emerging field.

What Are chatbots?
If you’ve spent any amount of time on the internet, it’s likely that
you’ve experienced messages like
“Hello. How may I help you?”
popping up when you visit certain websites. That’s a chatbot.
In other words, a chatbot is a software application that simulates a
person-to-person human conversation.
Chatbots connect human end-users with computer-generated
information or services via an online voice-based or text-based
interface.
Social networking platforms and websites often have text-based
chatbots to provide information and support. Over-the-phone
services typically have voice-based chatbot applications.
Chatbots help both consumers and businesses, as they play a vital
role in reducing tech barriers, streamlining navigation, optimizing
user experiences, and lowering support-related costs by up to
30 percent.
CHATBOT BASICS

Several studies reveal that in most cases, AI chatbots provide
more precise, faster results than those of a human support
professional, boosting the likelihood of successful business
outcomes.
How Do Chatbots Work?
A majority of human-chatbot interactions take place on business
websites.
Customer service chatbots pop up when users navigate a website
for a couple of minutes or exhibit behaviors that indicate that
they are “lost” or have problems finding the information they are
looking for.
When the chat window pops up, users can type in their questions
in simple, syntactical English.
The chat bot’s built-in language recognition feature breaks down
the query and, at lightning speed, compares the user’s question to
its database of previously solved queries that delivered satisfying
results for similar situations.
Subsequently, the chatbot presents the most relevant and best
information to the user and completes the query with other useful
tips that might interest the user.
Types of chatbots
Chatbots are of two types—standalone applications and those
integrated into messengers, including Facebook and WhatsApp
Messenger, Telegram, LINE, Snapchat, Viber, Skype, Slack, Kik,
Discord, and QQ.
Incorporating a chatbot into a messenger would be a smart choice
for a new business, as many people use the popular messenger
platforms globally.
Messenger chatbots help businesses build a connection with their
audience instantly, as most of their customers are already using
messaging services.

While every business has tasks in mind that they want a chatbot
to accomplish, there are, nevertheless, some broad benefits that
chatbots offer to all businesses, irrespective of their industry or
primary use cases.
Online Marketing and E-Commerce
Many people are familiar with eBay, Sephora, 1-800-Flowers, and
H&M chatbots.
Research shows that these chatbots improved communications
and boosted revenues for these companies in a short time.
Studies also indicate that the e-commerce and online marketing
industries significantly benefit from AI chatbots. Some key
benefits include:
Substituting cold emails - Brands that use chatbots no longer
have to compose thousands of emails, as the chatbot can
establish direct communication with customers.
Sales funnel management - chatbots can determine which
customers fall under which sales funnel. This helps businesses
design best-selling approaches for increased conversion.
TODAY’S BEST-KNOWN
CHATBOTS, INDUSTRY
APPLICATIONS, USE
CASES, AND BENEFITS

Interactivity additions - AI chatbots, with interactive
communication technology, enable brands to upsell and cross-
sell their products and services to their customers.
Personalized relationship-building - chatbots can incorporate
elements of a human personality. This gives users the feeling
that they are chatting with a real person, which augments
engagement and user experience.
Travel, Tourism, and Hospitality
Industry leaders, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Waylo,
Marriott, and Wynn Las Vegas, are leveraging AI chatbots to
improve the quality of their services and add value to their
organizational processes.
From offering 24/7 assistance to making travel suggestions, and
helping customers book rooms and trips on the go, chatbots are
transforming the entire travel, tourism, and hospitality sector.
The major advantages of implementing AI chatbots in the travel,
tourism, and hospitality industries are as follows:
Audience engagement - When users inquire about a flight,
the chatbot analyzes the query and produces relevant content
with additional information, for instance, details about hotel
room availability, nearby restaurants, cab services, and
weather forecasts. When users get to know so many things
right away, they keep coming back for more.
Need Anticipation and Recommendations - Intelligent
chatbots learn from every interaction. When AI chatbots
gain enough knowledge about a customer’s travel habits,
they start providing them with personalized offerings and
recommendations based on previous requests.
Automated solution - A hotel’s chatbot can facilitate
automated, self-service solutions, allowing guests to request
room service, order meals, or modify their reservations without
any human interference.

24/7 service - AI chatbots offer round-the-clock customer
service, enabling guests to get answers to their queries at any
time of the day, not having to wait for a response from a real
person.
Healthcare
In a critical sector like healthcare, where human lives are at stake,
nothing can be a substitute for a real medical professional.
However, in recent times, AI chatbots are emerging as lifesavers in
several areas.
Some use-cases of AI chatbots in the healthcare sector are:
Self-monitoring and self-care - chatbots enable self-monitoring
and self-care support, helping patients keep track of their
health. For example, if a patient feeds the chatbot with vital
signs, such as blood sugar levels, pulse rate, weight, and
blood pressure, the bot can conduct a thorough analysis of
the medical data provided and offer suggestions. If there
is a concern, the chatbot will automatically schedule an
appointment with the doctor.
Chatbots are also great for setting reminders about taking
medication, drinking water, adding health data, and doing
exercises.
Reliable medical information - When connected to various
medical databases, AI chatbots can deliver relevant and
reliable information to patients, helping them gain a better
understanding of their health status.
New patient data - Thanks to chatbots, new patients do not
have to spend time and effort filling out long, complicated

questionnaires. Instead, new patients can interact with the
chatbot to record their medical history. The chatbot will
analyze the same and generate vital data in a few seconds.
Banking and Finance Industry
Some of the world’s leading banks and financial institutions,
including Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, PayPal, American
Express, and many others, have integrated AI chatbots into their
services to offer seamless experiences to customers.
Capital One’s chatbot Eno and financial assistants Trim and
HiCharlie are already a big hit with users.
Here is how AI chatbots are improving user experiences:
Prompt notifications and alerts - chatbots alert users
whenever they detect any unusual activity, such as a sign-in
from a new device, browser, or location. It also notifies users
about upcoming fees, charges, or changes in policies and
guidelines.
Smart wealth management tips - chatbots can offer users
practical tips to help them find effective ways to invest or
spend their wealth based on past transaction history.
Around-the-clock service - chatbots are like 24/7 financial
assistants, who are ready to provide friendly advice,
information, and answers, no matter when the customer makes
a query.

The Increasing Role of AI and
Machine Learning in Chatbots
At the heart of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is NLP (Natural-
Language Processing) and ML (Machine Learning).
While machine learning techniques serve as the basis for building
different types of chatbot algorithms, natural language processing
detects human conversation patterns and even imitates them.
ML and NLP, the two most prominent Artificial Intelligence
features, combined, allow an AI chatbot to perceive human
behavior and emotions in near real-time, helping it deliver
superlative customer experiences.
Today’s AI chatbots have come a long way from the chatbots of
the past, which used to generate pre-programmed stock answers.
The success of modern-day chatbots rests on the accessibility of
various online data sources, such as search, email, e-commerce,
mobile app, and social media data.
INDUSTRY GROWTH
AND CAREER
OPPORTUNITIES

Increased access to vast amounts of data, and advancements
in technologies to analyze it in real-time, are augmenting the
efficiency of AI chatbots radically, resulting in more improved and
effective solutions to requests.
Therefore, the better the DMP (Data Management Platform), the
smarter the AI chatbot becomes.
In addition, the AI’s ML capabilities help improve the chatbot’s
self-learning abilities, and when the ‘self-learned’ data gets
uploaded to the DMP, it further enhances the chatbot’s capacity
to produce superior results.
