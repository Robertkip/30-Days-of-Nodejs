Advantages of Callback Abstraction
Callback abstraction offers several advantages in Node.js development. Some of these advantages include:

Improved code organization and modularity: By abstracting the details of asynchronous operations into separate functions, we can organize our code more effectively and make it more modular. This makes it easier to understand and maintain, as well as easier to reuse code that performs similar operations.
Easier error handling: Callback abstraction allows us to handle errors more easily by passing them as the first argument to the callback function. This makes it easier to write error handling code and to handle errors in a consistent way across our application.
Better performance: Callback abstraction can improve the performance of our applications by allowing us to write asynchronous code that runs in parallel, rather than sequentially. This can help reduce the overall time it takes to execute our code and improve the responsiveness of our applications.
Reusability: Abstraction makes it easier to reuse code that performs similar operations in different parts of our application. This can save development time and make our code more efficient.
