Advantages of Callback Abstraction
Callback abstraction offers several advantages in Node.js development. Some of these advantages include:

Improved code organization and modularity: By abstracting the details of asynchronous operations into separate functions, we can organize our code more effectively and make it more modular. This makes it easier to understand and maintain, as well as easier to reuse code that performs similar operations.
Easier error handling: Callback abstraction allows us to handle errors more easily by passing them as the first argument to the callback function. This makes it easier to write error handling code and to handle errors in a consistent way across our application.
Better performance: Callback abstraction can improve the performance of our applications by allowing us to write asynchronous code that runs in parallel, rather than sequentially. This can help reduce the overall time it takes to execute our code and improve the responsiveness of our applications.
Reusability: Abstraction makes it easier to reuse code that performs similar operations in different parts of our application. This can save development time and make our code more efficient.



Assignment for the file 
##test.js

panies
Given an array of asynchronous functions functions, return a new promise promise. Each function in the array accepts no arguments and returns a promise. All the promises should be executed in parallel.

promise resolves:

When all the promises returned from functions were resolved successfully in parallel. The resolved value of promise should be an array of all the resolved values of promises in the same order as they were in the functions. The promise should resolve when all the asynchronous functions in the array have completed execution in parallel.
promise rejects:

When any of the promises returned from functions were rejected. promise should also reject with the reason of the first rejection.
Please solve it without using the built-in Promise.all function.
