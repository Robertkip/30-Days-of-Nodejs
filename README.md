Yes, that's correct! In Node.js, you can perform file I/O operations using the fs module. The fs module provides wrappers around standard POSIX functions for file system operations such as reading, writing, deleting, and renaming files.

To use this functionality, you need to require the fs module in your Node.js code. Here's an example of how to require the fs module:


  const fs = require('fs');
After requiring the fs module, you can use its methods to perform file I/O operations. The methods provided by the fs module support both synchronous and asynchronous forms.

For synchronous file I/O operations, you can use methods with the 'Sync' suffix, such as fs.readFileSync() and fs.writeFileSync(). These methods block the execution until the operation is completed.

On the other hand, for asynchronous file I/O operations, you can use methods without the 'Sync' suffix, such as fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile(). These methods allow for non-blocking execution and utilize callbacks or Promises to handle the results of the operation.

It's important to note that when using asynchronous methods, you'll need to provide a callback function or handle Promises to handle the result of the operation, as they do not block the execution flow like the synchronous methods.

I hope this clarifies how to use the fs module in Node.js for file I/O operations.
